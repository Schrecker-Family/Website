#My Family History

On this site I will put the stories of some of my ancestors and their families. I have the good fortune to have been descended from people who have come from many places and cultures, giving me a personal connection to a lot of history.

My father's family were a European Ashkenazi Jewish family, mainly living in Bohenia, Austria and Slovakia. They lived through the many periods of persecution of the Jews in Europe, with many leaving in the 1930s to settle in either the UK or the Americas.

My mother's family origins are Irish (and Scottish), and English. They experienced various rises and falls in their fortunes, some of the Irish leaving for America in the mid 1800s, whilst those who remained lived through the turmoil of the struggles for Irish independence in the late 19th and ealry 20th centuries.

For the moment these are summaries generated using openai/gpt-oss-20b in LM Studio from data collected in RootsMagic 11, but over time I will flesh out the stories :slight_smile:
