## Biography  

### Early Life (1901–1920)  
- **24 December 1901** – Alice Bischitzky was born in Prague, then part of the Austro‑Hungarian Empire. Her parents were **Emil Bischitzky** (1868–1948) and **Gabriella Heller** (1875–1962).  
- Alice had two brothers: **Otto Josef Bischitzky** (1898–1900) and **Robert Bischitzky** (1900–1942).  
- Prague at the turn of the century was a multicultural city with significant Jewish, German, and Czech populations. The city’s intellectual climate was shaped by the decline of imperial authority and the rise of nationalist movements.

### Marriage (1921)  
- **18 December 1921** – Alice married **Robert Schrecker** (1893–1957) at the Tempelgasse Synagogue in Vienna, Austria.

### Early Adult Years in Germany (1933)  
- **1933** – Alice departed from Frankfurt am Main, Hessen, Germany. The same year Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, marking the beginning of the Nazi regime.

### Emigration to the United Kingdom (1935–1940)

### Post‑War Life in England (1940–1987)  
- After the war, Alice continued to reside in London. The 1960s saw her relocate to **Bath, Somerset**, a historic city known for its Georgian architecture and Roman baths.
