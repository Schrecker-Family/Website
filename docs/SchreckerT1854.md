## Historical Context

### The Austro‑Hungarian Empire (1854‑1918)
During Schrecker’s lifetime, the Austrian Empire became the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867. Vienna emerged as a cosmopolitan capital, fostering economic growth and cultural diversity. The Jewish community played an active role in commerce, finance, and the arts.

### Industrialization
The late 19th century saw rapid industrial development in Vienna, especially in metalworking and manufacturing. Schrecker’s shift to iron brokerage in 1882 coincided with increased demand for industrial materials.

### World War I (1914‑1918)
The war strained the empire’s economy and society. By 1915, Schrecker was living in Marinelligasse 7; the war likely impacted his professional activities and personal life.

### Post‑War Austria
After 1918, the empire dissolved, forming the Republic of Austria. Schrecker died in 1921 during this transitional period.
