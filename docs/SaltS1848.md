## Historical Context (1848–1908)

| Era | Key Events & Trends |
|-----|----------------------|
| **1840s–1850s** | The Industrial Revolution accelerates; railways expand. In Staffordshire, coal mining and pottery industries thrive. |
| **1850s–1860s** | Reform Act 1867 expands the electorate; the Chartist movement’s influence wanes. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 remains in force, affecting rural poverty. |
| **1870s–1880s** | The Elementary Education Act 1870 establishes compulsory schooling; Victorian social reform gains momentum. In Ireland, the Land War (1881‑1892) heightens tensions between landlords and tenant farmers. |
| **1890s–1900** | The rise of the Labour movement; debates over Home Rule for Ireland intensify. Technological advances bring electricity and telegraphy to rural areas. |
| **Early 1900s** | The Edwardian era begins (1901). Social attitudes shift toward greater gender equality, though women still lack voting rights. The First World War looms on the horizon (1914). |

Susanna’s life intersected with these developments: she grew up during industrial growth, married into the Anglican clergy during Ireland’s agrarian unrest, and lived in a rural Irish community that was beginning to experience the early stirrings of modernity.
