# Robert Schrecker – A Life in the Mid‑Century

## Summary  
Robert Schrecker (16 Nov 1893 – 7 Dec 1957) was a Viennese‑born merchant who spent most of his adult life in London, with brief periods in Frankfurt. He began his career at the Banca Commerciale Italiana in London, survived internment during World I, married in Vienna, and later became a Freemason in Frankfurt. During the Second World War he served as an Air‑Raid Precautions (ARP) communication warden and worked for a chemical manufacturer in London. He was naturalised as a British citizen in 1946 and lived his final years in Wimbledon until his death in 1957. His family—his wife Alice Bischitzky and their three sons—continued to thrive in post‑war Britain.

## Early Years (1893–1911)

Robert Schrecker was born on **16 November 1893** in Vienna, Austria‑Hungary, to Theodor Schrecker (1854–1921) and Berta Neurath (1861–1931). He was one of eight children: Elsa, Martha, Clara, Paul, Franz, Karl, and himself. Vienna at the turn of the twentieth century was a cosmopolitan capital of the Austro‑Hungarian Empire, home to vibrant cultural life and a thriving Jewish community. The Schrecker family was part of that community, which played an active role in commerce and civic life.

In **September 1911**, Robert moved to London, England. By the time of his arrival he was just 17 years old. The early 1910s in London were marked by industrial expansion, a growing expatriate population, and the looming threat of conflict that would soon erupt into World I.

## Early Career in London (1912–1914)

On **16 October 1912**, Robert commenced employment at the **Banca Commerciale Italiana** in London. The bank, an Italian‑run institution, catered to international trade and finance—a fitting workplace for a young immigrant with multilingual skills. He worked there until the outbreak of war, and by **10 June 1914** he was residing at **27 Bryanston Street**, a residential address in central London.

The period leading up to 1914 was one of increasing political tension across Europe. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo later that year would trigger the First World War, dramatically altering the lives of millions—including those in Britain.

## Internment During World I (1915–1919)

With the outbreak of war, Britain declared an **internment** policy against enemy nationals. As a citizen of Austria‑Hungary, Robert was placed in detention on **7 August 1915** at Alexandra Palace, London. Internment camps were common for German, Austrian, and Hungarian nationals; many detainees were allowed to work in the civilian economy under strict supervision.

Robert remained interned until **7 January 1919**, shortly after the war ended. His release came at a time when Britain was grappling with post‑war reconstruction, the introduction of new immigration regulations, and the integration of returning ex‑interns into civilian life.

## Return to Vienna and Marriage (1921–1923)

After his release, Robert returned to Vienna. On **18 December 1921**, he married **Alice Bischitzky** (1901–1987) at the **Tempelgasse Synagogue** in Vienna. The ceremony took place during the interwar period, a time when Austria‑Hungary had dissolved into several nation‑states and Vienna was redefining itself as the capital of a new, smaller Republic of Austria.

In **1923** (27 September), Robert formally resigned his Jewish faith. The early 1920s in Austria were marked by political instability, economic hardship (hyperinflation and reparations), and rising nationalist sentiments. His decision to leave Judaism was recorded in Vienna’s official registers, though the motivations remain private.

## Freemasonry and Business in Frankfurt (1925–1931)

On **25 October 1925**, Robert became a member of the Freemasons in **Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, Germany**. Freemasonry was a widespread fraternal organization in Europe that promoted moral and intellectual development; membership often reflected a person’s social standing.

By **1931**, Robert was living at **Rheinstraße 18** in Frankfurt, where he worked as a **Kaufmann (merchant)** for the firm *Ellenberger & Schrecker*. The early 1930s in Germany were dominated by the Great Depression, hyperinflation, and the rise of extremist political movements. Frankfurt remained an important financial center despite these challenges.

## Return to Britain and World II (1939–1946)

In **1939**, Robert moved back to Britain. His address was listed as **138 Dora Road, Wimbledon, Surrey** (now part of London). He held the position of **Research & Sales Manager – Artificial Horn**, a role that likely involved research into synthetic materials used in manufacturing.

The outbreak of World II on 1 September 1939 saw Britain mobilise its entire society. Robert’s civic engagement is noted in the **ARP (Air‑Raid Precautions) Communications Warden** listing for Wimbledon on **29 September 1939**. ARP wardens were responsible for civil defence duties such as enforcing blackout regulations, coordinating rescue efforts, and ensuring public safety during air raids.

On **14 October 1939**, he began work as a **Research Worker** at a chemical manufacturing firm in London. The war effort required rapid development of new chemicals for munitions, explosives, and industrial processes.

## Naturalisation and Later Life (1946–1957)

Robert was naturalised as a British citizen on **23 October 1946**, with the declaration published in *The London Gazette* (issue 37825, page 6192). Post‑war Britain was focused on reconstruction, the establishment of the welfare state, and re‑establishing its place in a changing world.

He continued to reside at **138 Dora Road** (Wimbledon) until at least **1951**, where he was still listed as a resident. He remained in the same neighbourhood, contributing to local life through his professional work and civic duties.

Robert Schrecker died on **7 December 1957** in London. His will was probated on **6 February 1958**, confirming his status as a resident of London at the time of death.

## Family Legacy

Robert’s family life included his wife, **Alice Bischitzky** (1901–1987), and their three sons:

- **Peter Theodor Schrecker** (1923–2020)
- **Martin Gerhart Schrecker** (1925–2001)
- **Bruno Tom Schrecker** (born 1928)

The children were born in Vienna and Frankfurt before the family settled permanently in Britain. Their lifespans spanned the post‑war era, with Peter living into the 21st century and contributing to the family's legacy.
